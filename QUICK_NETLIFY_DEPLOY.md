- `netlify/functions/api.ts` - Serverless backend function  
- `build-netlify.js` - Custom build script

## 3-Step Deployment Process

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
```bash
# If not already done
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for Netlify deployment"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Connect to Netlify
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and sign up/login
2. Click **"New site from Git"**
3. Choose **GitHub** and authorize
4. Select your repository
5. Build settings should auto-populate from netlify.toml:
   - **Build command**: (automatically detected)
   - **Publish directory**: `dist`
   - **Functions directory**: `netlify/functions`

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables
In Netlify dashboard â†’ Site settings â†’ Environment variables, add:

**From Neon Dashboard**:
1. Go to [neon.tech](https://neon.tech)
2. Select your project

## Troubleshooting

**Build fails?**
- Check build logs in Netlify dashboard

- Make sure GitHub repository is updated

**API not working?**
- Check Functions tab in Netlify dashboard  
- Verify DATABASE_URL format includes `?sslmode=require`
- Test database connection from Functions logs

**Frontend loads but data doesn't save?**
